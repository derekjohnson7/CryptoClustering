# CryptoClustering

In this project, we use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. We will be clustering cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages using K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

In this project, we have successfully clustered cryptocurrencies based on their price change percentages using K-means clustering and PCA. We have identified the optimal number of clusters and visualized the clusters to gain insights into the impact of price changes on cryptocurrencies.
